# macOS Unit Test

Template to use as a starting point when learning TDD in Swift.

## Idea

The idea is to have the simplest and fastest setup to learn TDD in Swift. The project only has a unit test bundle and runs on macOS in order to have a faster feedback loop.

## Requirements

* macOS 10.13 or higher
* Xcode 9.3.1 or higher

## Run Tests

We use [XCTest](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xctest).

To run the tests:

* open the Xcode Project "macOSUnitTest.xcodeproj"
* select the "UnitTestBundle" iOS scheme
* Run by pressing "Product" > "Test" or by pressing [Cmd + U]
